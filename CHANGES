Revision history for Perl module CGI::Compress::Gzip

1.03  17 Oct 2008
      [FIXES]
      - A speculative \n fix for Win32

1.02  16 Oct 2008
      [FIXES]
      - Make the test code more robust against reordered headers

1.01  07 Oct 2008
      [FIXES]
      - CGI.pm is downcasing headers on some smoke machines.  I don't know why.

      [PREREQUISITES]
      - Upped Compress::Zlib to v2.  Paul Marquess has pointed out
        that I can use improvement in Compress::Zlib to get streaming
        under mod_perl

1.00  06 Oct 2008
      [FIXES]
      - OK, the last one didn't really fix it.  This time I think I nailed it with the help of:
        srezic via http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/10/msg2382496.html
        (and many others)
      [PREREQUISITES]
      - Added Compress::Zlib.  At least one user was bitten by
        IO::Zlib's support for shelling out to command-line gzip.

0.23  05 Oct 2008
      [FIXES]
      - FINALLY fixed a long standing, spurious test failure due to
        envvars not passed to subprocesses.  For example:
