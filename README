CGI::Compress::Gzip

WARNING: as of v0.13 this is still alpha-quality code on some
platforms.  It runs just fine in perl 5.6.0, 5.6.1 and 5.8.0 and
mod_perl 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 under linux and darwin.  It is known to fail
on Windows and Solaris.  Debugging help would be greatly appreciated
on these platforms!

0.13 added support for CGI redirect() method (turn off compression if
     HTTP Status is not 200)
0.12 fixed bug where header changes weren't rolled back on failure
0.11 fixed a content-type bug and added handy diagnostics.
0.10 finally got mod_perl working.
0.04 just fixed some minor issues.
0.03 was an improvement over 0.02 in that the mod_perl headers work,
     but the gzip filter was still broken.

CGI::Compress::Gzip extends the CGI infrastructure to compresses
output, whenever possible.  It uses IO::Zlib (a filehandle wrapper
around the C zlib library).  If this is missing, the functionality
degrades gracefully to the typical CGI behavior.  The programmer can
selectively enable or disable the compression functionality at will.
This module does not rely on any particular server setup.  It should
work anywhere that CGI.pm works.

Apache mod_perl users may prefer the more straightforward
implementation offered by the Apache::Compress or Apache::GzipChain
modules, although those offer less control to the programmer.

Install via the usual:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

KNOWN ISSUES: 

* This module fails tests specifically under Windows in ways I do not
  understand, as reported by CPANPLUS testers.  There is some problem
  with my IO::Zlib tests.  If anyone knows about IO::Zlib failures or
  caveats on Windows, please let me know.  It *might* be related to
  binmode, but I have not tested this theory.

* This module has been observer to fail on Solaris.  The error is very
  strange and may be Compress::Zlib's fault.  In a nutshell,
  Compress::Zlib gets into infinite recursion in its AUTOLOAD
  function.  I don't know the cause yet...
